            </p>
            <p>
              This is not a limitation we are working around — it is the product. An instrument
              that trains on its own scores is a scale that calibrates itself from what it
              weighed yesterday. Every number it produces afterwards is contaminated, and a
              regulator would be right to refuse it. Our harvesting guard already enforces this:
              nothing a benchmark item would match may enter the knowledge base, and the
              knowledge base is read at runtime, pinned and signed, never trained on.
            </p>
            <p>
              We measured what that costs. The knowledge base grew from <strong>28 to 76
              entries</strong> overnight and benchmark coverage moved <strong>14/193 →
              14/193</strong>. Zero. Forty-five correct new entries bought no measured
              improvement, precisely because the guard forbids harvesting anything a benchmark
              item would match. <strong>That is the design working, not a limitation to fix.</strong>

              The same rule governs what we take from others: we map other benchmarks'
