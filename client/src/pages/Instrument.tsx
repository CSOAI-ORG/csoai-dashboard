/**
 * Instrument — the GSPC surface. One chat pane, four lenses, a sidebar of measured tools.
 *
 * WHY THIS SHAPE, AND WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT COPIED FROM LMARENA
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * LMArena's *ranking methodology* is open (`arena-rank`, Apache-2.0). Its *platform* is not.
 * So the statistics are fair game and the surface is ours to build — which is the right split
 * anyway, because we are not a battle site. We are a measurement body, and the two have
 * opposite obligations: an arena optimises engagement, an instrument optimises defensibility.
 *
 * What is worth taking is NARROWER than it first looks. Pairwise comparison is more efficient
 * than absolute scoring — exactly our bottleneck, since 0 of 15 dimensions resolve at an MDE of
 * ~63 points against margins of 1–15. But Arena-Rank's mechanism is Bradley-Terry over HUMAN
 * PREFERENCE VOTES, and crowd judgement is precisely what design law 1 forbids. So: borrow the
 * CI-with-explicit-n presentation, reject the Elo. A battle here must resolve from the five
 * deterministic predicates against a hashed provision — never from a vote. Ballot-stuffing,
 * which has demonstrably skewed vote-based arenas, is neutered by construction.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE LINE THAT MUST NOT BE CROSSED — and it is the reason this page exists in this form.
 * Public battle votes may NEVER enter the benchmark. GovBench items are exact-match scored and
 * the knowledge base is harvested under a guard that forbids ingesting anything a benchmark
 * item would match. Feeding site traffic back in is the circularity the overnight harvester
 * was already built to prevent, and it would void every published score. Battle votes are a
 * SEPARATE, disclosed, opt-in signal with their own leaderboard — never merged.
 *
 * Everything rendered below is either (a) computed client-side from deterministic logic that
 * ships in this bundle, or (b) a figure with a named artefact behind it. Nothing is typed in.

              <strong>0 of 15 governance dimensions currently resolve.</strong> Every model is
              statistically tied because the minimum detectable effect is ≈63 points against
              observed margins of 1–15. More absolute-scored items barely move that: going from
              6 to 11 items per dimension moved interval resolution by exactly zero.

              Pairwise comparison is more statistically efficient than absolute scoring, which
              is why arena-style ranking resolves where ours does not. But <strong>the mechanism
              that gets them there is one we cannot use</strong>: Arena-Rank (Apache-2.0) is a
              Bradley-Terry model over <em>human preference votes</em> — crowd judgement, and our
              first design law is that every primary score is deterministic with no judge. So we
              borrow the <em>presentation</em> — a score with an explicit 95% CI and an explicit
              n — and reject the Elo. Any battles here would resolve a pairwise verdict from the
              five deterministic predicates against a hashed provision, never from a vote.

                Public votes may <strong>never</strong> enter the benchmark. GovBench items are
                exact-match scored, so harvesting site traffic back into them is circular and
                would void every published score. Battle votes will be a separate, disclosed,
                opt-in signal with their own leaderboard — never merged into GovBench, and never
                used as training data.
