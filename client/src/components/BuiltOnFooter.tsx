/**
 * BuiltOnFooter — the attribution strip: what we stand on, and under which licence.
 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * WHY THIS IS NOT A PARTNER LOGO WALL
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * The ask was a slider of partner logos — Oracle, NVIDIA and so on — to strengthen social
 * authority. It is not built that way, deliberately, for three reasons:
 *
 *   1. **It would be a false association.** We have no partnership with Oracle or NVIDIA. We
 *      can reach an NVIDIA API endpoint (and today not even that — the key is a placeholder).
 *      Displaying a company's mark implies endorsement, and that is the same class of claim as
 *      the "CSOAI is ISO 17065 certified" line removed from the live site today.
 *   2. **Logos are trademarks.** Using them to borrow status is a trademark problem before it
 *      is a credibility problem, and most vendor brand guidelines forbid exactly this use.
 *   3. **It fails the one test that matters here.** A reader who checks a single logo, finds no
 *      partnership, and concludes we inflate — now discounts every measured number on the site.
 *      The estate's whole asset is that its numbers survive checking. A logo wall risks that
 *      asset to gain something it cannot honestly claim.
 *
 * What is here instead is stronger AND partly mandatory: open-source licences *require*
 * attribution, so crediting what we actually build on is compliance as well as credibility.
 * Every row is something this estate genuinely uses, anchors to, or publishes under — and
 * every row is checkable in about ten seconds, which is the point.
 *
 * ⚠️ RULE FOR ANYONE EDITING THIS FILE: a row may be added only if we actually depend on the
 * thing, anchor to it, or publish under it. "We could integrate this" is not a row. If a
 * relationship is ever real (a signed agreement, a named partnership), it goes in a separate
 * PARTNERS block with the nature of the relationship stated — never mixed in here.
